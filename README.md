### About Me

Hi! I'm Panagiotis Karastathis, a junior software developer with a strong focus on Python, web development, and interactive applications. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Ionian University, where I've worked on projects ranging from augmented reality apps for museum interaction to machine learning web apps using Streamlit and Docker.

I'm passionate about building clean, user-friendly digital experiences and exploring innovative technologies like AR and data analytics. In my current role as a retail sales consultant at Dixons Carphone, I combine technical knowledge with customer service to guide users through tech solutions. I enjoy working in collaborative environments, continuously improving my skills, and bringing ideas to life through code.

### Favorite Project

#### Augmented Reality Mobile App for Museums (Thesis Project)

As part of my thesis, I developed a mobile application that enhances the museum visitor experience using marker-based Augmented Reality (AR) and object detection. The app allows users to scan physical exhibits with their phone camera and receive real-time AR overlays, such as 3D models, historical information, or interactive content.

Built with a focus on accessibility, user engagement, and educational value, this project combined technologies like Unity, Vuforia, and TensorFlow Lite. The goal was to bridge physical and digital interaction, making cultural learning more immersive and intuitive.

### University Projects

As part of my studies at the Department of Informatics, Ionian University, I’ve developed several projects that combine software development, emerging technologies, and real-world applications:

- Interactive Machine Learning App with Streamlit & Docker
  
Built a user-friendly web app that demonstrates machine learning concepts in real time using Streamlit. Docker was used to containerize the application for consistent deployment and portability.

- E-Commerce Website: TechZen (WordPress & WooCommerce)
  
Designed and developed a fully functional online store, focusing on UI/UX, payment integration, and inventory management. Custom themes and plugins were implemented to simulate a real-world business scenario.

- Semantic Web Ontologies & Social Network Analysis
  
Modeled ontologies using OWL and Protégé, exploring knowledge representation on the semantic web. Also performed a social network analysis of a Discord community using NetworkX and Gephi to identify patterns in communication and influence.

- Linux Shell Commands Guide (Bash)

Wrote a CLI tool and mini-manual to help new users learn common Linux commands, permissions, and scripting basics.
